Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{-0.1in}\setlength\parindent{24pt}
I am excited to submit my application for the Site Reliability Engineer position. With over three years of specialised experience at Akamai Technologies, I have built a proven track record of driving automation, reliability, and operational excellence in large-scale, mission-critical environments directly aligning with your team's focus on modernising complex systems and championing SRE best practices.

In my current role as Site Reliability Engineer II, I have led multiple cross-functional initiatives to automate infrastructure provisioning, optimize CI/CD pipelines, and deploy robust observability solutions. My work has resulted in a 50\% reduction in manual operations, a 75\% improvement in deployment times, and a 30\% reduction in system downtime. I have hands-on expertise in Python, Linux shell scripting, and configuration management with Ansible as well as deep experience with monitoring and telemetry tools including Otel, Grafana, and ELK Stack.

I am eager to bring my automation-first mindset, technical depth, and collaborative spirit to your SRE team, helping to ensure the availability, reliability, and scalability of your platforms.

Thank you for considering my application.
